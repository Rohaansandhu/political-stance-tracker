# United States Political Stance Tracker
Analyzes voting records to show where US Congress Members stand on major political issues and spectrums. Built upon the amazing tools of [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress).

## Setup
Clone this repo and install dependencies in a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the congress project is cloned as a submodule inside this repo.
Follow the [congress repo instructions](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) to download all necessary packages and tools.

## Usage

### 0. Fetch Roll Call Data
Using the [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) submodule, run:
```bash
usc-run votes
```
Output: `data/{congress}/votes`

This will download all voting roll call data. You can specify congress or session with the --congress or --session flags. Please make sure you run this command in the top-level directory so the data populates in the correct folder.

### 1. Fetch Current Legislators
Downloads the latest legislator information and saves it locally as JSON:
```bash
python3 get_current_legislators.py
```
Output: `data/current-legislators.json`

### 2. Process Votes by Member
Parses all roll call votes for the current Congress and outputs one JSON file per legislator containing their voting record:
```bash
python3 process_votes_by_member.py
```
Output: `data/organized_votes/{member_id}.json`

### 3. Get Voted Bills
Fetches bill status for all bills that have been voted on and marks them accordingly. Also generates `data.json` files for bill XML data.
```bash
python3 get_voted_bills.py [--force]
```
Use `--force` to re-download and re-parse all bill data.

### 4. Generate Bill Analyses
Analyzes bills using an LLM and generates a `bill_analysis.json` for each voted bill.
```bash
python3 generate_bill_analysis.py [--force]
```
Use `--force` to overwrite existing analyses.

### 5. Calculate Member Ideology
Processes all legislators and calculates ideology scores based on their voting records and bill analyses.
```bash
python3 calc_member_ideology.py
```
Output: `data/legislator_profiles/{member_id}.json`

### 6. Member Ranking
Ranks legislators by political spectrums and categories, generates summary reports and CSV exports.
```bash
python3 member_ranking.py
```
Outputs:
- `data/rankings/all_rankings.json` (full rankings)
- `data/rankings/extremes_summary.json` (summary of most extreme legislators)
- `data/rankings/csv/` (CSV exports)

## Data Output
All outputs are stored in the generated `data/` folder and its subdirectories.

## Current State & TODOs
This project is actively under development. The following features and improvements are planned or in progress:

- **Refine bill analysis LLM prompts:** Improve the quality and consistency of bill analyses generated by the LLM. LLM responses vary by nature, but by creating a proper frame and structure, and by possibly adjusting model temperatures, a more predictable and accurate response can be achieved.
- **Resolve data irregularities:** Address issues with current rankings and political stances to ensure accuracy and reliability. Spectrum ranges are extremely variable. Libertarian and Authoritarian leanings need to be implemented better.
- **Add graphs and visualizations:** Integrate graphical outputs to better illustrate findings and trends.
- **Add results folder for findings:** Create a dedicated folder to store summary results, visualizations, and key insights generated to show this tool's output. 

If you have suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
