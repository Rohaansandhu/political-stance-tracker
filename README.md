# United States Political Stance Tracker
Analyzes voting records to show where US Congress Members stand on major political issues and spectrums. Built upon the amazing tools of [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress).

If you're curious about the role of LLMs in legislation summaries and possible political analysis, I'd highly recommend checking out this paper from 2024 [political-llm.org](https://political-llm.org/).


## Setup
Clone this repo and install dependencies in a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Congres Project Required!!!
Make sure the congress project is cloned as a submodule inside this repo.
Follow the [congress repo instructions](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) to download all necessary packages and tools.

### MongoDB Setup (Required!)
This project uses MongoDB to store and query vote and bill data. However, you'll notice a lot of initial scripts (that pull data from congress) will still store to the data/ directory as well. You can start and stop the database using the provided scripts:

**Start MongoDB:**
```bash
python3 start_mongod.py
```
This will start a local MongoDB server on port 27017 by default, with data stored in `data/db` and logs in `data/mongodlogs/`. Replica set support is available (see script for details).

**Stop MongoDB:**
```bash
python3 stop_mongod.py
```
This will cleanly shut down the MongoDB server.

You must have MongoDB installed and available in your system PATH. For more advanced configuration, feel free to edit `start_mongod.py`.

### LLM API Key Required
To use the bill analysis features, you must create your own LLM API Key using one of the supported providers:
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Google Ai Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), [Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.ai/).
This allows you to use the LLM of your choice for bill analysis.

1. Set your API key in your .env file (recommended) or run this (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the correct api key from your provider of choice):
  ```bash
  export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
  export GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
  export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
  ```
2. Also, depending on which provider you choose, you will need to specify the client: (`openrouter`, `gemini`, or `cerebras`)
```bash
  export CLIENT=YOUR_CLIENT_CHOICE
  ```
3. You can now use the LLM-powered scripts in this project.
4. (Optional) All providers are accessed through the OpenAI Client Libraries. If you wish, you can find another provider with this library and add it to bill_analysis_client.py with ease.


### Environment Variables To Set
Here is a list of all environment variables needed in this project:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` if you use openrouter
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` if you use gemini
- `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` if you use cerebras
- `CLIENT` to specify between openrouter, gemini, and cerebras
- `MODEL` to specify the model name from the client
- `MONGO_URI` to specify the db instance
- `DB_NAME` to specify the db name

## Usage

### 0. Fetch Roll Call Data
Run the following script to fetch roll call vote data and automatically load it into the database:

```bash
python3 get_votes.py [--congress=NUM] [--session=NUM] [--sessions=LIST] [--force] [--fast]
```
- `--congress`, `--session`, `--sessions`: Specify which congress/session(s) to fetch.
- `--force`: Force re-download of all vote data.
- `--fast`: Only pull data from the last 3 days.

This script internally calls the `usc-run votes` command, which downloads all voting roll call data into the `data/{congress}/votes` directory.  
You can also run `usc-run votes` directly with its options if you prefer:
```bash
usc-run votes [--congress=NUM] [--session=NUM] [--sessions=LIST] [--force] [--fast]
```
Make sure you run these commands in the top-level directory so the data populates in the correct folder.


### 1. Process Votes by Member
Organizes roll call votes by member, from MongoDB, and outputs to MongoDB (or data/).
```bash
python3 process_votes_by_member.py [--writeData]
```
Options:
- `--writeData`: If specified will also store to the data/ folder

Output: MongoDB 'member_votes' collection.

### 2. Get Voted Bills
Fetches bill status for all bills that have been voted on and marks them accordingly. Also generates `data.json` files for bill XML data. Automatically uploads bill data to MongoDB.
```bash
python3 get_voted_bills.py [--force]
```
Use `--force` to re-download and re-parse all bill data.

Output: bill_data collection

### 3. Generate Bill Analyses
Analyzes bills using an LLM and generates a `bill_analysis.json` for each voted bill. Processes bills from MongoDB.
```bash
python3 generate_bill_analysis.py [--force] [--numOfBills num] 
```
Options:
- `--force`: Overwrite existing analyses and update outdated schemas.
- `--numOfBills`: Only process num bills (useful for testing or limiting API usage).

Output: MongoDB bill_analyses collection

### 4. Calculate Member Ideology
Processes all legislators and calculates ideology scores based on their voting records and bill analyses. Please specify model (required) and schema version of the bill analyses you want to use.
```bash
python3 calc_member_ideology.py [--model model] [--schema schema] [--congress congress] [--chamber chamber] [--bill_type type1 type2...]
```
Options:
- `--model`: Specify the model to analyze data from
- `--schema`: Specify the schema version to analyze data from (optional, will default to latest)
- `--congress`: (Optional) Specify the congress
- `--chamber`: (Optional) Specify the chamber (house, senate)
- `--bill_type`: (Optional) Specify one or more bill types

Output: legislator_profiles collection

### 5. Create Plots
Uses the legislator_profiles collection to create histograms and boxplots of congress members' data. You must spec_hash of the profiles you want to create plots from. 
```bash
python3 create_plots.py [--spec_hash spec_hash]
```
Options:
- `--spec_hash`: (REQUIRED) Specify the specific legislator profiles to make plots with

In the future, this script will take in options for congress (113-119), chamber (house or senate), and possibily more.

### Ensure Correct Indexes in MongoDB
Ensures that all collections have the correct unique index restrictions.
```bash
python3 db_utils.py
```

## Data Output
All outputs are stored in MongoDB or the generated `data/` folder.

## Current State & TODOs
This project is actively under development. The following features and improvements are planned or in progress:

- **Refine bill analysis LLM prompts:** Improve the quality and consistency of bill analyses generated by the LLM. Political category and spectrum definitions must be adjusted continously. The current spectrum and category descriptions are extremely generic and may not even be completely accurate. The current categories and spectrums are merely a starting point for this project.
  
  *Progress: Added versioning to model prompts. Refined the categories and spectrums, gave partisan and impact scores to both.*
- **Address LLM hallucinations and faulty analyses:** LLMs, especially the smaller non-commercial open source models are prone to hallucinations and faulty analyses. Hallucinations can be counteracted with strategies such as feature attribution, casual modeling, and validation checkpoints.
  
  *Progress: Not started.*
- **Address LLM biases:** LLMs are prone to political bias. This is being greatly reduced across the board with the commercial flagship versions, however, the open source models may still be prone to this bias. This is something to be worked on at a later date, as it is hard to adjust for this without any control over the model's parameters.
  
  *Progress: Not started.*
- **Include more voting data:** Many votes happen on small amendments to a larger bill. These votes are currently not included due to a lack of sufficient scrapable data online for the content of each amendment. If it's possible to find better summary descriptions for smaller amendment votes, these will be added. Also, legislators sponsor different bills. It may be worth looking at the different bills that legislators sponsor, because if a legislator sponsors a bill, then logically speaking they strongly support that bill. 
  
  *Progress: Not started.*
- **Add results website for findings:** Create a dedicated website to show summary results, visualizations, and key insights generated to show this tool's output.
  
  *Progress: Will add soon for initial findings. Once more data is crunched and organized, the results will be made public. The plan is to completely gather data from the 113th to 119th congress.*

If you have suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
